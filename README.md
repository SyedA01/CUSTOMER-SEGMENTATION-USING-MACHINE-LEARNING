## Dataset Source

The dataset used for this project was sourced from [kaggle]. You can obtain the dataset by :https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akram24/mall-customers ].

### Dataset Description

[Provide a brief description of the dataset, including its structure and the types of data it contains. For example:]

The dataset consists of customer information, including demographics, Annual income, and Spending Score. It is provided in CSV format and includes the following columns:

- `CustomerID`: A unique identifier for each customer.
- `Name`: Customer's full name.
- `Age`: Customer's age.
- `Gender`: Customer's gender.
- `Annual Income': Details of past purchases.
- `Spending Score`: Online activity and engagement metrics.

[Include any additional details that are specific to your dataset.]

## Dependencies

- Python (>=3.6)
- Required Python libraries can be found in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SyedA01/CUSTOMER-SEGMENTATION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING.git
cd customer-segmentation
python -m venv venv
On Windows:

bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate

Creating a well-structured README file is essential for ensuring that others (or even your future self) can understand and run your customer segmentation project. Here's a template for a README file that explains how to run the code and lists any dependencies:
